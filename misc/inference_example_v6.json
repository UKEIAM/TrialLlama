  "input" : "Here is an example patient note: A 46-year-old Asian woman with MDD complains of persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest in daily activities. She states that her mood is still depressed most of the days. She complains of loss of energy and feelings of worthlessness nearly every day. She is on anti-depressants for the past 6 months, but the symptoms are still present. She does not drink alcohol or smoke. She used to exercise every day for at least 30 min., but she doesn't have enough energy to do so for the past 3 weeks. She also has some digestive issues recently. She is married and has 4 children. She is menopausal. Her husband was diagnosed with colon cancer a year ago and is undergoing chemotherapy. Her past medical history is unremarkable. Her family history is negative for any psychologic problems. Her HAM-D score is 20.\n Here is an example clinical trial: Title: Theta Burst Study Ghent\\nSummary: 50 Right-handed antidepressant-free unipolar depressed patients (age 18-65 years) will be treated with in total 20 Theta burst sessions; these will be spread over 4 days. On each stimulation day, a given patient shall receive 5 sessions with a between session delay of 10 to 15 minutes. Patients will be selected using the structured Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). All will be at least stage I treatment resistant. Because concomitant antidepressant treatment can confound outcome results, all patients will go through a medication washout before entering the study and they will be free from any antidepressant, neuroleptic and mood stabilizer for at least two weeks before entering the treatment protocol. Only habitual benzodiazepine agents will be allowed. All patients will be closely matched for gender and age with 50 never-depressed medication-free healthy volunteers. Only baseline measurements will be collected: no volunteer will undergo the treatment. We expect that real Theta burst treatment and not sham will result in a significant and clinical meaningful response.\\nIntervention Type: Other\\nInclusion Criteria: Inclusion Criteria: - antidepressant-free unipolar depression - age between 18 and 65 years - right handed - at least stage I treatment resistant \\nGender:All\\nMinimum age:18 Years\\nMaximum age:65 Years\\nHealthy volunteers:Accepts Healthy Volunteers\\nExclusion Criteria: - current or past history of epilepsy, neurosurgical interventions, having a pacemaker or metal or magnetic objects in the brain, alcohol dependence and suicide attempts within 6 months before the start of the study.\nHere is an example response: Inclusion Criteria:\n\nantidepressant-free unipolar depression: Eligible\nage between 18 and 65 years: Eligible\nright-handed: Not Relevant for Clinical Trial\nat least stage I treatment resistant: Eligible\nExclusion Criteria:\n\ncurrent or past history of epilepsy: Not Relevant for Clinical Trial\nneurosurgical interventions: Not Relevant for Clinical Trial\nhaving a pacemaker: Not Relevant for Clinical Trial\nmetal or magnetic objects in the brain: Not Relevant for Clinical Trial\nalcohol dependence: Eligible\nsuicide attempts within 6 months before the start of the study: Eligible\nBased on the provided information and the criteria for the clinical trial, the patient would likely be considered eligible for the clinical trial since she meets the inclusion criteria and does not meet the specified exclusion criteria.\n\nSo, the patient is \"eligible\" for the clinical trial.\n",
