Title: Tele-diagnostics for Remote Parkinson's Monitoring Summary: The purpose
of this research study is to design, implement, and clinically assess a
portable, user worn system for monitoring Parkinson's disease (PD) motor
symptoms. The current standard in evaluating symptoms is the Unified Parkinson's
Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), a subjective, qualitative ranking system. The main
goal of this research is to develop a quantitative system, Kinesia HomeView, to
assess tremor as well as different features of bradykinesia in a home based
system which can capture those symptom changes over the course of a day and aid
in evaluating treatment protocol efficacy. Intervention Type: Device INCLUSION

  >Clinical Trial</strong
><br />Here is the clinical trial: Title: Study of Factors Associated With the
Volumetric and Areal Bone Mineral Density and Bone Strength in Parkinson's
Disease Summary: Studies show that patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease
(IPD) have an increased risk of fracture, particularly hip fracture whose
complications and postoperative mortality appear to be higher than in the
general population. This increased risk of fracture is due partly to an
increased risk of falling, and secondly to an impairment of bone tissue with
lower bone mineral density (BMD). A meta-analysis concluded that patients with
IPD have lower BMD than healthy controls. Prospective studies also showed rapid
bone loss in these patients compared with controls. The association between low
BMD and IPD seems dependent on the severity and duration of the disease even if
some data are contradictory. Various mechanisms may explain this bone loss
including weight loss, malnutrition and a low level of physical activity.
However, enrollments in these studies are often weak and it is difficult to
conclude on the real impact of these factors on bone loss in the IPD. The main
objective of our study is to assess and prioritize from these various bone loss
mechanisms. Bone assessment by "peripheral quantitative computed tomography"
(pQCT) will also assess the impact of various risk factors on bone strength
parameters. The prevalence of vertebral compression fractures in the IPD, at
this day unknown can be evaluated. This study will also estimate the prevalence
of vertebral compression fractures in the IPD. Intervention Type: Procedure

trial: Title: Obesity in G60 Trauma Patients Summary: Obesity is a national
epidemic that affects all aspects of health care, including trauma care.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1% of US adults 20
years old and older are obese (body mass index [BMI], calculated as weight in
kilograms divided by height in meters squared, > 30), and 69% are overweight
(BMI > 25) (1, 2). Obesity is a major health concern because of its established
relationship with serious medical diseases and increased likelihood of comorbid
conditions (eg, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, heart disease, pulmonary
disease) (3). As the number of obese adults continues to increase, the potential
number of obese trauma patients with severe injury and complications will also
increase (3). Management of prehospital and in-hospital trauma care, including
complications associated with airway management, surgical procedures, and
radiological imaging, of obese patients can be challenging. However, published
reports on how obesity complicates hospital stays after trauma are conflicting
(4, 5). Several studies have indicated that obese trauma patients are more
likely than non-obese patients to have longer stays in the intensive care unit
(ICU) and hospital, more days of mechanical ventilation, more complications, and
comorbid conditions, and higher mortality (6,7,8). Other studies have indicated
no differences between obese and nonobese patients in mortality, length of stay
in the ICU and the hospital, duration of mechanical ventilation, complications,
or comorbid conditions (9). Accordingly, the main aim of this study is to
investigate and compare hospital course, clinical outcomes, disposition, and the
cost of treatment between geriatric obese and non-obese patients hospitalized
for treatment of traumatic injuries. INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Male and female
patient's ≥ 60 years of age. 2. Blunt and penetration injury. EXCLUSION

  >Clinical Trial</strong
><br />Here is the clinical trial: Title: A Trial of MitoQ for the Treatment of
People With Parkinson's Disease Summary: In Parkinson's Disease, the
mitochondrial membranes in cells that produce dopamine become damaged by
oxidants, leading to the death of these cells and progressive tremor, slowness
of movement and the loss of neurons in the substantia nigra (a part of the brain
that is involved in movement). Mitoquinone is targeted to reach the membrane of
mitochondria and provide protection from damaging oxidants. There are no
treatments currently available to slow the progression of PD and this trial will
help advance the development of this unique disease modifying drug. This trial
will enroll 120 participants with untreated early onset of PD. Participants will
be randomized to receive 1 of 3 treatments: 40 mg of MitoQ tablets, 80 mg of
MitoQ tablets or placebo. The researchers, participants and sponsor will all be
blinded to the treatment allocation. Participants will be assessed after 1, 2,
3, 6, 9, 12 months of treatment and again 28 days after their last dose. The
effectiveness of the trial drug will be measured via the Unified Parkinson's
Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). The safety of the trial drug will be monitored via
regular participant examinations, blood tests, ECG and collecting information on

  >Clinical Trial</strong
><br />Here is the clinical trial: Title: Effect of Nutritional Intervention and
Olive Oil in Severe Obesity Summary: Obesity is a worldwide epidemic with
increasing prevalence, specially severe obesity (Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 35
kg/m2). It is a multifactorial disease that involves genetic and environmental
factors that lead to increased mortality from cardiovascular disease, diabetes,
cancer, among others and impairs life quality. Most research on severe obesity
focuses on surgical alternatives and their results, thus this clinical trial
aims to evaluate the effect of a non-pharmacological approach based on
nutritional intervention and supplementation with a functional food, the olive
oil. It will analyze the effectiveness of interventions on: weight loss,
improvements on body composition and inflammatory profile (TNF-alfa,
interleucins 1, 6 and 10, adiponectin), insulin resistance and serum lipids
control, changing eating habits and physical activity practice, modification on
bone mineral density and sarcopenia, and reduction of cardiovascular risk and
other diseases. Also, it will be investigated the influence of polymorphisms
(Pro12Ala of PPAR-γ gene, -174G>C of IL6 gene e Trp64Arg of ADRB3 gene) on
nutritional intervention effectiveness with and without olive oil. This research
looks for improving severely obese patient's care and contributing to effective
results by reducing costs and risk treatment. The investigators believe that
this informations will contribute significantly to the scientific field,
expanding the knowledge about severe obesity. Intervention Type: Dietary

  >Clinical Trial</strong
><br />Here is the clinical trial: Title: Sleep Apnea Syndrome and Vitamin D
Summary: Obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is a highly prevalent
disorder with multiple comorbidities. OSAHS is characterized by repetitive
episodes of airflow reduction (hypopnoea) or cessation (apnoea) due to upper
airway collapse during sleep. Its major risk factor is obesity. However, its
pathogenesis is complex and multifactorial. Reduced upper airway muscle tonus
and/or unstable neuromuscular output seem to be involved in this collapsus. A
normal vitamin D status is necessary for normal muscle function and
neuromuscular output. As obesity is associated with a high rate of
hypovitaminosis D, it appears of interest to evaluate the effect of vitamin D
supplementation on OSAHS patients with vitamin D deficiency. Intervention Type:
Drug INCLUSION CRITERIA: - Moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnoea (AHI >
