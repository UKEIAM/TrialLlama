On each stimulation day, a given patient shall receive 5 sessions with a between session delay of 10 to 15 minutes. Patients will be selected using the structured Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). All will be at least stage I treatment resistant. Because concomitant antidepressant treatment can confound outcome results, all patients will go through a medication washout before entering the study and they will be free from any antidepressant, neuroleptic and mood stabilizer for at least two weeks before entering the treatment protocol. Only habitual benzodiazepine agents will be allowed. All patients will be closely matched for gender and age with 50 never-depressed medication-free healthy volunteers. Only baseline measurements will be collected: no volunteer will undergo the treatment. We expect that real Theta burst treatment and not sham will result in a significant and clinical meaningful response.\n\nIntervention Type: Other\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n- Current or past history of epilepsy\n- Neurosurgical interventions\n- Having a pacemaker or metal or magnetic objects in the brain\n- Alcohol dependence\n- Suicide attempts within 6 months before the start of the study\n\nIs the patient eligible for the clinical trial?\n\nBased on the patient's age of 46 years, gender, and absence of any exclusion criteria, the patient would likely be considered eligible for the clinical trial.
