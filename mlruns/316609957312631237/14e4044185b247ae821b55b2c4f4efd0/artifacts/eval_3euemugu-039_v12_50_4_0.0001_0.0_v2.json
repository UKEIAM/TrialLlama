Here's an example of what I'm trying to do:\n\n\\begin{code}\ntemplate <typename F>\nvoid foo(F f) {\n    \/\/ do something with f\n}\n\nint main() {\n    foo([](int x, int y) { return x + y; }); \/\/ compile error\n    return 0;\n}\n\\end{code}\n\nI'm getting a compile error that says \"no match for 'operator(' in 'foo([](int x, int y) { return x + y; })'\".\n\nI know that lambdas can be passed as function objects in C++11, so I'm not sure what's going on here. Can someone explain how to pass a lambda function as a function object to a template function in C++?\n\nAnswer: You need to wrap the lambda function in a function object, like this:\n\n\\begin{code}\ntemplate <typename F>\nvoid foo(F f) {\n    \/\/ do something with f\n}\n\nint main() {\n    foo([] (int x, int y) { return x + y; }); \/\/ works\n    return 0;\n}\n\\end{code}\n\nThe reason for this is that the lambda function is not a function object in the sense that the standard library templates expect. A function object is an object that overloads the `operator()` method, which allows it to be called like a function. The lambda function does not overload `operator()`, so it cannot be passed directly to a function template that expects a function object.\n\nBy wrapping the lambda function in a function object, you create an object that overloads `operator()`, which allows you to pass it to the template function.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a lambda expression as a function object by using the `std::bind` function to bind the lambda to a `std::function` object. Here's an example:\n\n\\begin{code}\ntemplate <typename F>\nvoid foo(F f) {\n    \/\/ do something with f\n}\n\nint main() {\n    auto lambda = [] (int x, int y) { return x + y; };\n    foo(std::bind(lambda, lambda)); \/\/ works\n    return 0;\n}\n\\end{code}\n\nThis approach is more flexible, because it allows you to pass the lambda function as a function object to any function that expects a function object, without the need to wrap it in a separate function object.","PROBA":0.9105834745},{"ID":"17273_36-2021_NCT03386773","TOPIC_YEAR":2021,"RESPONSE":"$}}%\nC: irrelevant","PROBA":0.5734809061},{"ID":"16956_36-2021_NCT00826774","TOPIC_YEAR":2021,"RESPONSE":"Tags: #<Tag:0x007ffc8883c88>\n\nB: excluded","PROBA":0.6829509264},{"ID":"35364_75-2021_NCT00666653","TOPIC_YEAR":2021,"RESPONSE":"Tags: #<Tag:0x007ffc8883c888>\n\nA: eligible","PROBA":0.7427213597},{"ID":"5352_12-2021_NCT02071654","TOPIC_YEAR":2021,"RESPONSE":"Tags: #<Tag:0x007ffc8883c88>\n\nA: eligible","PROBA":0.7100619469},{"ID":"35578_75-2021_NCT02753621","TOPIC_YEAR":2021,"RESPONSE":"# A: eligible","PROBA":0.7001391991},{"ID":"13941_30-2021_NCT00328926","TOPIC_YEAR":2021,"RESPONSE":"Tags: #<Tag:0x007ffc8883c88>\n\nB: excluded","PROBA":0.6925563735},{"ID":"17063_36-2021_NCT01734187","TOPIC_YEAR":2021,"RESPONSE":"Tags: #<Tag:0x007ffc8883c888>\n\nA: eligible","PROBA":0.7209342529},{"ID":"33506_71-2021_NCT01026181","TOPIC_YEAR":2021,"RESPONSE":"Home > News > featured news > The Importance of Sleep for Athletes\nThe Importance of Sleep for Athletes\nSleep is essential for athletes, as it plays a critical role in their physical and mental recovery, as well as their overall performance.

This is especially important for athletes who engage in high-intensity or high-impact activities, as they may be more susceptible to injury if they do not get enough sleep.\n\nTo get the most out of their sleep, athletes should aim to get at least 7-9 hours of sleep each night, and should establish a consistent sleep schedule to help regulate their body's internal clock. Additionally, athletes should avoid caffeine, nicotine, and other stimulants before bedtime, as these can interfere with sleep quality and duration.\n\nIn conclusion, sleep is essential for athletes who want to perform at their best. By prioritizing sleep and establishing a consistent sleep schedule, athletes can improve their physical and mental recovery, enhance their cognitive function, and reduce their risk of injury.","PROBA":0.9235152198},{"ID":"27721_40-2022_NCT02150031","TOPIC_YEAR":2022,"RESPONSE":"Tags: #<Tag:0x007ffc8883c888>\n\nA: eligible","PROBA":0.6968857448},{"ID":"27553_40-2022_NCT00835211","TOPIC_YEAR":2022,"RESPONSE":"# A: eligible","PROBA":0.7241337555},{"ID":"35595_75-2021_NCT02894567","TOPIC_YEAR":2021,"RESPONSE":"Tags: #<Tag:0x007ffc08c8c88>\n\nA: eligible","PROBA":0.6963992986}]
