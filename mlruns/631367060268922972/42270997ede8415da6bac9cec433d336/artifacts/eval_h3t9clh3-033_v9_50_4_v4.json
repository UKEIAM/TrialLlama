He is an alert and cooperative man who does not have any signs of dementia. He does not smoke or use any illicit drugs.\n\nClinical Trial:\n\nTitle: Spinal Cord Stimulation for the Treatment of Motor and Nonmotor Symptoms of Parkinson's Disease\n\nSummary: Although DBS improves patient's quality of life advanced Parkinson's patients (PD) by addressing the cardinal symptoms and reducing levodopa motor complications, symptoms still worsen over time. Postural problems, frequent falls, freezing of gait impairment and other locomotion difficulties still remain as important causes of disability and incapacity. Novel therapeutics approaches are needed to restore quality of life (QoL). This study aims to explore the effects of spinal cord stimulation in locomotion, falls and freezing of gait in advanced PD patients. Twenty PD patients will undergo thoracic spinal cord stimulation at high frequencies in a prospective study for six months. Changes in locomotion capacity and freezing of gait rating will be the primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes will be: QoL and common motor outcome measures in PD patients. Always comparing the status before, one, three and six months after stimulation was initiated. A double-blind trial will be performed within three months of follow-up (high X low frequency stimulation).\n\nINCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n1. Idiopathic PD\n2.
