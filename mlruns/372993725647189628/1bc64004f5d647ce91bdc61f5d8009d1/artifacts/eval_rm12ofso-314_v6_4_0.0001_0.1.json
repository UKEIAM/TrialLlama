This study is not introducing a new form of labour monitoring; it is evaluating the addition of decision-support to CTGs displayed on the Guardian\u2122 system. Specifically comparing: \"No decision-support\" - CTGs with no additional interpretation (UK standard care), compared with: \"Decision-support\" - CTGs with the decision support software running that will alert clinicians to the presence of abnormalities in the CTG in real time. How the labour is managed is entirely up to the recruiting unit and the woman; however the allocation of decision-support or no decision-support is determined randomly by the Guardian\u2122 system.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n\u2022 triplets or higher order pregnancy\n\u2022 criteria for EFM not met, including elective caesarean section prior to the onset of labour\n\nIs the patient eligible for the clinical trial?\n\nPlease provide your answer based on the given information.","PROBA":0.9958866522},{"ID":"16916_36_NCT00478504","TOPIC_YEAR":2021,"RESPONSE":"#1: Yes, the patient is eligible for the clinical trial.\n\n#2: No, the patient is not eligible for the clinical trial.\n\nPlease select one of the above options by typing '1' or '2'.","PROBA":0.9943121849},{"ID":"14087_30_NCT02319538","TOPIC_YEAR":2021,"RESPONSE":"#1: Yes, the patient is eligible for the clinical trial.\n\n#2: No, the patient is not eligible for the clinical trial.\n\nPlease select one of the above options based on your assessment of the patient's eligibility for the clinical trial.","PROBA":0.9936603014},{"ID":"19017_27_NCT03966014","TOPIC_YEAR":2022,"RESPONSE":"$}}%E2%80%8B%20Patient%20Note%3A%20A%2031-year-old%20woman%20comes%20to%20the%20office%20due%20to%203%20days%20of%20rash%20on%20her%20left%20arm.%20The%20lesion%20is%20mildly%20pruritic%20but%20not%20painful.%20She%20is%20otherwise%20healthy%20and%20occasionally%20takes%20ibuprofen%20during%20the%20first%20few%20days%20of%20her%20menstrual%20period.%20Temperature%20is%2037%20C%2C%20blood%20pressure%20is%20110\/75%20mm%20Hg%2C%20and%20pulse%20is%2095\/min.%20The%20lesion%20is%20like%20a%20target%20sign%20known%20as%20erythema%20migrans.%20She%20recently%20went%20for%20an%20adventure%20trip%20in%20New%20Hampshire.%20The%20patient%20is%20diagnosed%20with%20Lyme%20disease.%0A%0AHere%20is%20the%20clinical%20trial%3A%0A%20Title%3A%20Different%20Amoxicillin%20Treatment%20Regimens%20in%20Erythema%20Migrans%20Patients%0A%20Summary%3A%20The%20purpose%20of%20this%20study%20is%20to%20compare%20the%20efficacy%20of%20different%20amoxicillin%20treatment%20regimens%20in%20patients%20with%20erythema%20migrans.%0A%20Intervention%20Type%3A%20Other%0A%20Exclusion%20Criteria%3A%20-pregnancy%20-%20extracutaneous%20manifestations%20of%20Lyme%20borreliosis%20-%20immunocompromising%20state%20-%20serious%20adverse%20event%20to%20beta%20lactam%20antibiotic%20-%20receiving%20antibiotic%20with%20antiborrelial%20activity%20within%2010%20days%0A%0AIs%20the%20patient%20eligible%20for%20the%20clinical%20trial%3F%20%7B%20A%3A%20eligible%2C%20B%3A%20excluded%2C%20C%3A%20not%20relevant%20for%20clinical%20trial%20%7D%3B\n\nPlease check the patient's eligibility for the clinical trial based on the provided information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","PROBA":0.9967425723},{"ID":"30796_65_NCT02727231","TOPIC_YEAR":2021,"RESPONSE":"# Patient Eligibility\n\nBased on the patient's information, the patient is eligible for the clinical trial.
