Additionally, she is currently taking Levothyroxine, which is within the allowed medication list of the study, and her thyroid function tests are within the normal range except for anti-TPO, which is included in the study's inclusion criteria.\n\nWould the patient be eligible for the clinical trial? \n\nO: eligible","PROBA":0.7745964602},{"ID":"16980_36_NCT01026584","TOPIC_YEAR":2021,"RESPONSE":")A: eligible \nB: excluded \nC: not relevant for clinical trial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","PROBA":0.9242773988},{"ID":"25320_36_NCT02494687","TOPIC_YEAR":2022,"RESPONSE":"    A) Eligible\n     B) Excluded\n     C) Not relevant for clinical trial \n\nPlease explain your answer.","PROBA":0.7749532947},{"ID":"30811_65_NCT02893306","TOPIC_YEAR":2021,"RESPONSE":"}","PROBA":0.0355127286},{"ID":"25109_36_NCT00789061","TOPIC_YEAR":2022,"RESPONSE":"Our team will compare the data provided in the clinical trial with the patient's note and determine their eligibility. Please provide us with the patient's note and the clinical trials.\n\nHere is the patient's note:\n\nA 47-year-old woman comes to the clinic complaining of dizziness. She also has occasional nausea and ringing in her right ear. The patient also has difficulty hearing while holding her phone to the left ear, although hearing in her right ear is normal. The dizziness improves spontaneously, and she feels fine between episodes. Past medical history is notable for hypothyroidism and low vit D level, for which she is using Levothyroxine and Vit D pearl. She does not use tobacco or drink alcohol. Physical examination shows sensorineural hearing loss in the left ear. She has only one-man sexual partner and menopaused 2 years ago.\n\nAnd here is the clinical trial:\n\nTitle: Applying Proton Pump Inhibitor to Prevent and Treat Acute Fluctuating Hearing Loss in Patients With SLC26A4 Mutation\nSummary: Disequilibrium between acid and base in the inner ear was suggested to be an important factor leading to hearing impairment associated with SLC26A4 mutations. For acid-base homeostasis in the inner ear, gastric-type proton pumps might demonstrate antagonistic effects to pendrin, the protein encoded by SLC26A4. To investigate whether proton pump inhibitors might prevent or treat acute fluctuating hearing loss related to SLC26A4 mutations, we launch the current double-blind randomized clinical trial.\nIntervention Type: Drug\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age between 18 and 65 years\n* SLC26A4 mutation\n* Dizziness\/vertigo\n* Hearing loss\n* Occasional nausea and tinnitus\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who do not fulfill both of the above criteria\n\nBased on the patient's note, the patient does not meet the Inclusion Criteria of the clinical trial because she does not have a SLC26A4 mutation. Therefore, the patient is excluded from the clinical trial. \n\n","PROBA":0.9135262333},{"ID":"25568_36_NCT04331015","TOPIC_YEAR":2022,"RESPONSE":"$   $ $ $ $ $ $   $$$$ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $$ $ $ $ $ $$ $ $ $ $$ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $$ $$ $ $$ $ $ $ $$ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $$ $ $ $ $ $$ $$ $$ $$ $ $ $ $ $ $$ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $  $ $ $ $ $$ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $$ $$ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $$ $ $ $ $$ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $$ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $$ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $$ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $$ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $$ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $$ $ $ $ $ $ $ $$ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $$ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $$ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $$ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ MOV $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $$ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $$ $$ $ $ $$ $$ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ OK  $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $$ $ $$$ $ $ $ $ $$ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $$\n\nIs the patient eligible for the clinical trial?","PROBA":0.8788098695},{"ID":"27734_40_NCT02264730","TOPIC_YEAR":2022,"RESPONSE":"\"A 23-year-old female has prolonged oral bleeding immediately after a tooth extraction.
