Title: Tele-diagnostics for Remote Parkinson's Monitoring
Summary: The purpose of this research study is to design, implement, and clinically assess a portable, user worn system for monitoring Parkinson's disease (PD) motor symptoms. The current standard in evaluating symptoms is the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), a subjective, qualitative ranking system. The main goal of this research is to develop a quantitative system, Kinesia HomeView, to assess tremor as well as different features of bradykinesia in a home based system which can capture those symptom changes over the course of a day and aid in evaluating treatment protocol efficacy.

Title: Study of Factors Associated With the Volumetric and Areal Bone Mineral Density and Bone Strength in Parkinson's Disease
Summary: Studies show that patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) have an increased risk of fracture, particularly hip fracture whose complications and postoperative mortality appear to be higher than in the general population. This increased risk of fracture is due partly to an increased risk of falling, and secondly to an impairment of bone tissue with lower bone mineral density (BMD). A meta-analysis concluded that patients with IPD have lower BMD than healthy controls. Prospective studies also showed rapid bone loss in these patients compared with controls. The association between low BMD and IPD seems dependent on the severity and duration of the disease even if some data are contradictory. Various mechanisms may explain this bone loss including weight loss, malnutrition and a low level of physical activity. However, enrollments in these studies are often weak and it is difficult to conclude on the real impact of these factors on bone loss in the IPD. The main objective of our study is to assess and prioritize from these various bone loss mechanisms. Bone assessment by "peripheral quantitative computed tomography" (pQCT) will also assess the impact of various risk factors on bone strength parameters. The prevalence of vertebral compression fractures in the IPD, at this day unknown can be evaluated. This study will also estimate the prevalence of vertebral compression fractures in the IPD.

Title: Obesity in G60 Trauma Patients
Summary: Obesity is a national epidemic that affects all aspects of health care, including trauma care. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1% of US adults 20 years old and older are obese (body mass index [BMI], calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared, > 30), and 69% are overweight (BMI > 25) (1, 2). Obesity is a major health concern because of its established relationship with serious medical diseases and increased likelihood of comorbid conditions (eg, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, heart disease, pulmonary disease) (3). As the number of obese adults continues to increase, the potential number of obese trauma patients with severe injury and complications will also increase (3). Management of prehospital and in-hospital trauma care, including complications associated with airway management, surgical procedures, and radiological imaging, of obese patients can be challenging. However, published reports on how obesity complicates hospital stays after trauma are conflicting (4, 5). Several studies have indicated that obese trauma patients are more likely than non-obese patients to have longer stays in the intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital, more days of mechanical ventilation, more complications, and comorbid conditions, and higher mortality (6,7,8). Other studies have indicated no differences between obese and nonobese patients in mortality, length of stay in the ICU and the hospital, duration of mechanical ventilation, complications, or comorbid conditions (9). Accordingly, the main aim of this study is to investigate and compare hospital course, clinical outcomes, disposition, and the cost of treatment between geriatric obese and non-obese patients hospitalized for treatment of traumatic injuries.

Title: A Trial of MitoQ for the Treatment of People With Parkinson's Disease
Summary: In Parkinson's Disease, the mitochondrial membranes in cells that produce dopamine become damaged by oxidants, leading to the death of these cells and progressive tremor, slowness of movement and the loss of neurons in the substantia nigra (a part of the brain that is involved in movement). Mitoquinone is targeted to reach the membrane of mitochondria and provide protection from damaging oxidants. There are no treatments currently available to slow the progression of PD and this trial will help advance the development of this unique disease modifying drug. This trial will enroll 120 participants with untreated early onset of PD. Participants will be randomized to receive 1 of 3 treatments: 40 mg of MitoQ tablets, 80 mg of MitoQ tablets or placebo. The researchers, participants and sponsor will all be blinded to the treatment allocation. Participants will be assessed after 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12 months of treatment and again 28 days after their last dose. The effectiveness of the trial drug will be measured via the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). The safety of the trial drug will be monitored via regular participant examinations, blood tests, ECG and collecting information on adverse events.

Title: Effect of Nutritional Intervention and Olive Oil in Severe Obesity
Summary: Obesity is a worldwide epidemic with increasing prevalence, specially severe obesity (Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 35 kg/m2). It is a multifactorial disease that involves genetic and environmental factors that lead to increased mortality from cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, among others and impairs life quality. Most research on severe obesity focuses on surgical alternatives and their results, thus this clinical trial aims to evaluate the effect of a non-pharmacological approach based on nutritional intervention and supplementation with a functional food, the olive oil. It will analyze the effectiveness of interventions on: weight loss, improvements on body composition and inflammatory profile (TNF-alfa, interleucins 1, 6 and 10, adiponectin), insulin resistance and serum lipids control, changing eating habits and physical activity practice, modification on bone mineral density and sarcopenia, and reduction of cardiovascular risk and other diseases. Also, it will be investigated the influence of polymorphisms (Pro12Ala of PPAR-γ gene, -174G>C of IL6 gene e Trp64Arg of ADRB3 gene) on nutritional intervention effectiveness with and without olive oil. This research looks for improving severely obese patient's care and contributing to effective results by reducing costs and risk treatment. The investigators believe that this informations will contribute significantly to the scientific field, expanding the knowledge about severe obesity.

Title: Sleep Apnea Syndrome and Vitamin D
Summary: Obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is a highly prevalent disorder with multiple comorbidities. OSAHS is characterized by repetitive episodes of airflow reduction (hypopnoea) or cessation (apnoea) due to upper airway collapse during sleep. Its major risk factor is obesity. However, its pathogenesis is complex and multifactorial. Reduced upper airway muscle tonus and/or unstable neuromuscular output seem to be involved in this collapsus. A normal vitamin D status is necessary for normal muscle function and neuromuscular output. As obesity is associated with a high rate of hypovitaminosis D, it appears of interest to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on OSAHS patients with vitamin D deficiency.
